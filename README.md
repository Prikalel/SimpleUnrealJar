# SimpleUnrealAar

MyLibProj - Android Studio project for building a very minimal .aar library

MyProject - Unreal project that tries to connect to the .aar library

I did not manage to get the aar working. The working solution, if I remember correctly, was to pull manually the jar file out of aar package. Jar worked with unreal project.
